# Infrastructure contract

This directory contains the Docker Compose files that define the generated
project runtime. Keep these files compatible with two callers:

- local developers running `make dev-start`;
- external orchestrators that run generated projects as sibling containers and
  attach them to an already-created worker network.

## Service names

Compose service names are part of the project API. Other containers resolve
services by these DNS names on the default Compose network:

- `db` is PostgreSQL on port `5432` when the `backend` module is enabled.
- `redis` is Redis on port `6379` when `backend`, `tg_bot`, or `notifications`
  is enabled.
- `backend` is the FastAPI service on port `8000` when the `backend` module is
  enabled.
- `tg_bot`, `notifications_worker`, and `frontend` are the optional application
  services for their modules.

Do not rename these services without updating callers that use Compose DNS.
For example, generated defaults use `POSTGRES_HOST=db` and
`REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379`.

## Network rules

Do not declare custom networks in these compose files and do not rename the
implicit `default` network. External worker managers may replace the generated
project's default network with a pre-created network shared with the worker
container. This lets the worker reach `db:5432`, `redis:6379`, and
`backend:8000` directly without Docker-in-Docker or host port forwarding.

## Compose modes

Worker mode uses the base and dev layers only:

```bash
make worker-start
```

That target uses `-f infra/compose.base.yml -f infra/compose.dev.yml` and does
not include `infra/compose.local.yml`.

This starts every service in the selected module set without the local-port
layer. Pass `svc=...` to start only selected services. Backend projects have
both `db` and `redis`; bot-only or notifications-only projects have `redis` but
no `db`.

For a backend plus notifications project, a full worker-mode smoke run is:

```bash
make worker-start
make smoke-probe
make worker-call url=http://backend:8000/users method=POST body='{"name":"Ada"}'
make worker-stop
```

`make smoke-probe` defaults to `http://backend:8000/health` when the backend
module is present. To probe another in-network URL, pass both the Python service
used as a one-off runner and the URL:

```bash
make smoke-probe SMOKE_RUNNER=backend SMOKE_URL=http://backend:8000/health
```

Use `make worker-call` for non-GET requests:

```bash
make worker-call SMOKE_RUNNER=backend url=http://backend:8000/users method=POST body='{"name":"Ada"}'
```

Worker mode must not depend on published host ports. The dev layer keeps
services reachable on the Compose network, and the local-port layer is omitted.
`make migrate` and `make makemigrations name="..."` use this worker-mode layer
for their Docker path. Use `SKIP_INFRA_START=1` only when the database is
already reachable from the host process.

Local developer mode adds published ports:

```bash
make dev-start
```

This expands to:

```bash
docker compose \
  --project-directory . \
  -f infra/compose.base.yml \
  -f infra/compose.dev.yml \
  -f infra/compose.local.yml \
  up -d --build --wait
```

`infra/compose.local.yml` is the only layer that publishes development ports to
the host. Configure those ports in `.env`:

- `BACKEND_PORT` maps to `backend:8000`.
- `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT` maps to `db:5432`.
- `REDIS_HOST_PORT` maps to `redis:6379`.
- `FRONTEND_PORT` maps to `frontend:3000`.

Production mode uses:

```bash
docker compose \
  --project-directory . \
  -f infra/compose.base.yml \
  -f infra/compose.prod.yml \
  up -d --remove-orphans
```

Integration-test mode uses `infra/compose.tests.integration.yml` directly
through `make test-integration`.

## Parallel run isolation

Set a unique Compose project name when running multiple generated projects on
one Docker host:

```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=my-project-dev make dev-start
```

The generated `.env` and `.env.example` include a commented
`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` line for this. Pair it with distinct published host
ports in `.env` when the local-port layer is enabled:

- `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT` for PostgreSQL.
- `REDIS_HOST_PORT` for Redis.
- `BACKEND_PORT` for the backend HTTP service.
- `FRONTEND_PORT` for the frontend.

Use `make ps` and `make log <service>` to inspect the selected Compose project.
Plain `docker compose ps` does not load the generated `.env`; either use the
Makefile targets, export the same values in your shell, or pass the compose
files and project directory explicitly.

When running Compose by hand from the project root, include `--project-directory .`
so Compose reads the root `.env` and uses the same project name as `make`:

```bash
docker compose --project-directory . \
  -f infra/compose.base.yml \
  -f infra/compose.dev.yml \
  run --rm --no-deps backend \
  python -c 'import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlopen("http://backend:8000/health")'
```

`make worker-clean` runs `docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans` with
the base and dev layers only. `make dev-clean` does the same with the local
compose layer included. Both remove only resources under the selected Compose
project name.

External sibling-container orchestrators should keep passing Compose's
`--project-name` option explicitly when they need deterministic project names.
That mode still uses the base and dev layers without published host ports.

## Healthchecks

Infrastructure services must have healthchecks. External orchestrators and the
generated Makefile use `docker compose up --wait`, so readiness is defined by
Compose health state, not by sleep loops.

Current required healthchecks:

- `db`: `pg_isready` against the configured database.
- `redis`: `redis-cli ping`.
- `backend`: HTTP `GET /health`.

Do not remove these healthchecks when changing service definitions. If a new
infrastructure service is added, give it a healthcheck before depending on it
from application services or orchestration code.

## Database and Redis environment

Environment priority depends on where the value is consumed:

1. Compose interpolation values, such as `${POSTGRES_HOST:-db}`, use the shell
   or command environment first, then generated `.env`, then the default in the
   compose file.
2. Container variables loaded with `env_file` come from generated `.env`.
3. Local `make` commands include and export generated `.env`. Make command-line
   variables override it. A shell-prefix value before `make` does not override a
   variable already assigned by `.env` unless you opt into GNU Make environment
   precedence with `make -e`.
4. Local Python commands use process environment first, then application
   defaults.

For local `make` targets, `.env` is included and exported by the generated
Makefile. Pass overrides as make variables:

```bash
make POSTGRES_HOST=custom-db POSTGRES_PORT=6543 migrate
```

PostgreSQL can be configured by parts in Compose modes and by full URL for
local process commands:

- `POSTGRES_HOST` and `POSTGRES_PORT` select the host and port used to build
  Compose database URLs. The generated `.env` uses `db` and `5432`.
- `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` complete the Compose
  database URLs.
- `POSTGRES_REQUIRE_SSL` is read by backend settings when backend code builds a
  URL from parts outside Compose. The Compose-built `DATABASE_URL` and
  `ASYNC_DATABASE_URL` entries do not append `sslmode=require`.
- `DATABASE_URL` overrides the sync SQLAlchemy URL when backend code runs
  outside Compose.
- `ASYNC_DATABASE_URL` overrides the async SQLAlchemy URL when backend code runs
  outside Compose.

Use `POSTGRES_HOST=db` inside Compose worker/local modes. Use `localhost` or
another reachable host only when running backend tooling outside the Compose
network, for example with `SKIP_INFRA_START=1`. In worker/local Compose modes,
`DATABASE_URL` and `ASYNC_DATABASE_URL` are built by `compose.base.yml` from the
`POSTGRES_*` parts; shell values for the full URLs do not replace those service
environment entries.

Redis is configured by full URL:

- `REDIS_URL` is the application Redis endpoint. The generated `.env` uses
  `redis://redis:6379` when Redis is part of the selected modules.
- `TEST_REDIS_URL` overrides the Redis endpoint used by pytest fixtures.
- If `TEST_REDIS_URL` is not set, tests fall back to `TEST_REDIS_HOST` and
  `TEST_REDIS_PORT`, then to `localhost:6379`.

Use `REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379` inside Compose worker/local modes. Use
`TEST_REDIS_URL` when Redis tests should target an isolated database or an
externally managed Redis instance. In worker/local Compose modes, Redis
consumers load `REDIS_URL` from generated `.env`; a shell `REDIS_URL=... docker
compose ...` invocation does not override the container value unless `.env` or
the compose service environment is changed.
