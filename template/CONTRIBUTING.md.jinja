# Contributing Guidelines

We adhere to a strict set of rules to maintain quality and consistency. These rules are enforced by CI and the `make` commands.

## 1. The Golden Rule: Use the Makefile
Never run tools directly. Always use the `make` target.
- `make lint`: Runs all linters (ruff, xenon{% if 'backend' in modules %}, spec validation, spec compliance{% endif %}).
- `make format`: Runs auto-formatters.
- `make tests`: Runs the test suite.
{% if 'backend' in modules %}
- `make validate-specs`: Validates YAML specs before code generation.
- `make generate-from-spec`: Generates code from YAML specs.
{% endif %}

## 2. Code Style & Standards
We use `ruff` for linting and formatting, and `mypy` for static typing.

- **Naming:**
    - Use `snake_case` for variables, functions, and file names.
    - Avoid `camelCase`.
- **Typing:**
    - All functions must have type hints.
    - `mypy` is configured with `disallow_untyped_defs`.
- **Imports:**
    - Absolute imports are preferred.
    - Sort imports (handled by `ruff`).

## 3. Workflow for Agents & Humans

### Adding a New Service
1.  Add entry to `services.yml`.
2.  Create the service directory structure under `services/<name>/`.
3.  Implement the business logic.

{% if 'backend' in modules %}
### Modifying the API
1.  Edit `shared/spec/models.yaml` or service-level `services/<name>/spec/*.yaml`.
2.  Run `make validate-specs` to catch errors early (also runs automatically as part of `make lint`).
3.  Run `make generate-from-spec`.
4.  Update service code to use the new generated models/routers.
{% endif %}

### Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Each service has its own `tests/` folder.
- **Integration Tests:** Shared tests in the root `tests/` folder.
- **Coverage:** We aim for high test coverage.

## 4. "Read-Only" Zones
Do not manually edit files in these directories, as they are overwritten by scripts:
{% if 'backend' in modules %}
- `shared/generated/`
{% endif %}
- `services/<name>/` (only specific files like `src/` should be edited; structural files like `Dockerfile` are templated, though currently managed manually after creation - *check templates if you need to change infrastructure*).

## 5. Environment Variables

**STRICT RULE: NO DEFAULT VALUES FOR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**

- **NEVER** use default values in `os.getenv("VAR", "default")` or similar patterns
- If a required environment variable is missing, the application **MUST FAIL IMMEDIATELY** with a clear error
- Use this pattern:
  ```python
  value = os.getenv("REQUIRED_VAR")
  if not value:
      raise RuntimeError("REQUIRED_VAR is not set; please add it to your environment variables")
  ```
- **Rationale:** Default values hide configuration errors and cause silent failures in production
- All required environment variables must be documented in `.env.example`

## 6. Common Pitfalls

Avoid these common mistakes:

1. **Stale Shared Code:** In development, ensure `../shared:/app/shared:delegated` is mounted in `compose.dev.yml`. Without this mount, services use stale code from the Docker build, not live changes.

2. **Type Mismatches:** The code generator supports `list[type]` but verify complex types after generation.

3. **Timezone Awareness:** Use `datetime.now(UTC)` for Pydantic `AwareDatetime` fields, not naive `datetime.now()`.

4. **Dockerfile Copies:** COPY sources in Dockerfiles should stay within the service directory or use `shared/`.
{% if 'tg_bot' in modules or 'notifications' in modules %}
5. **Missing Broker Connection:** Publishing events without calling `broker.connect()` first results in `AssertionError`. Ensure broker lifecycle is managed in application startup/shutdown.
