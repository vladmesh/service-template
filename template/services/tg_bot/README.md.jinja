# Telegram Bot

This directory contains a minimal python-telegram-bot application. The
`main.py` file wires a `/start` handler and can be extended with more
commands, message handlers, or background jobs as you iterate.

## Development

Run `make setup` from the project root to create per-service venvs, then
start everything with `make dev-start`. The base Compose stack already
includes this service, so `make dev-start`
{% if 'backend' in modules %}
will build and start it automatically alongside the backend and database.
{% else %}
will build and start it automatically.
{% endif %}
If you only need the bot (or want to force a rebuild), target the service
explicitly:

```bash
docker compose -f infra/compose.base.yml -f infra/compose.dev.yml \
  up --build tg_bot
```

Feel free to add additional handlers, background tasks, or persistence
layers as needed.
