# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Typed environment-contract baseline fragments for infrastructure, backend and
  Telegram bot modules, with schema validation in template tests.
- Generated-project CI now checks static environment usage against contract
  fragments and uploads a commit-bound canonical contract artifact.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-11

Release of the dogfood sprint: two smoke runs, a 3x2 task/head matrix and a control
run, each followed by a fix wave (#27-#42). Full reports live in the operator's
control-panel repo (docs/dogfood/).

### Added
- REST router generator: a domain spec with a `rest:` section now produces a FastAPI
  router and registry wiring; `events.publish_on_success` publishes on the REST path
  (the `users` vertical does this for `user_registered`) (#40)
- Worker-mode make targets for external orchestrators and port-less runs:
  `worker-start`, `worker-stop`, `worker-clean`, `smoke-probe`, `worker-call` (#41, #42)
- Top-level Compose `name: ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME:-<slug>}` — manual `docker compose`
  gets a deterministic project name; explicit `--project-name` still wins (#42)
- `compose.local.yml` layer: host port publishing split from the dev layer; worker mode
  runs base+dev with no published ports (#33)
- `make dev-clean` (full teardown incl. volumes) and `make ps` (#32, #35)
- `BACKEND_PORT` in generated `.env`, parameterized datastore host ports
  (`POSTGRES_HOST_PORT`, `REDIS_HOST_PORT`) for parallel runs (#27, #35)
- Placeholder-token idle mode for standalone `tg_bot` — the container stays up and
  logs a warning until a real token is configured (#32)
- `infra/README.md` contract for external orchestrators: service DNS names, network
  rules, compose modes (#34)

### Changed
- Module selection moved from post-generation `rm -rf` tasks to templated copier
  `_exclude`: unselected modules are never rendered, generation is quiet, and
  `copier copy` no longer requires `--trust` (#36)
- `make makemigrations` works from the host and in worker mode: db comes up without
  published ports, `upgrade head` runs before autogenerate, `SKIP_INFRA_START=1`
  supports pre-provisioned databases (#30, #41)
- `make setup` no longer fails the whole bootstrap on user-code lint errors; deptry
  config aligned with `[dependency-groups]` across modules (#38)
- Dev compose runs services on image venvs instead of broken host-venv mounts (#28)
- Standalone `tg_bot` registered with its real service type instead of
  `python-faststream` (#31)

### Fixed
- Docs brought in line with reality: bootstrap via `uvx copier` with `--vcs-ref=HEAD`
  and no `--trust` (#29, #37), standalone-aware `tg_bot` AGENTS.md and base image
  version (#39), ARCHITECTURE.md matches the generated router registry (#40),
  lint gates (xenon thresholds) and `make setup`-first workflow documented (#39)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- `.dockerignore` in template — prevents host `.venv/` from contaminating Docker builds
- Frontend service in `compose.base.yml` — `compose.prod.yml` extends now works for full config
- Conditional broker in `lifespan.py.jinja` — backend-only no longer requires `REDIS_URL`
- 10 new regression tests in 3 classes:
  - `TestDockerReadiness`: dockerignore, login shell, lifespan broker, compose prod/dev validation, health assertion match
  - `TestCIWorkflowCorrectness`: standalone CI cleanup
  - `TestFormattingQuality`: services.yml blank lines
- Standalone tg_bot tests (`TestStandaloneGeneration`) — 7 tests for `modules=tg_bot`
- `@pytest.mark.slow` for `make setup`/`make lint` integration tests
- `make test-copier-slow` target for slow tests
- Copier tests re-enabled in pre-push hook and CI

### Fixed
- `bash -lc` → `bash -c` in `compose.dev.yml` — login shell was resetting Docker PATH
- Health integration test assertion `"healthy"` → `"ok"` to match actual endpoint
- CI Clean up step wrapped in backend conditional — no longer runs for standalone
- `services.yml.jinja` Jinja whitespace trimming — no more excessive blank lines
- Copier tests use `.venv/bin/copier` and `.venv/bin/ruff` instead of bare commands
- Copier test fixtures refactored to session-scoped (4 copier runs per session instead of ~40)

### Changed
- `lifespan.py` renamed to `lifespan.py.jinja` (now conditionally includes broker code)
- Copier tests fully rewritten — 68 fast + 5 slow tests (was 55 broken/skipped)

## [0.1.0] - Previous Version
